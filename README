This is a simple little Javascript element scroller, built using the scriptaculous libraries to control movement (you can get these here: http://script.aculo.us/); it requires a double layer div.

The outer layer div is fixed width - this should be the column width * the number of columns you want to show at any time. This then has an overflow:hidden value so that it hides the columns we don't want to see.

The inner layer should be the width of the number of colums * the column width.

The columns are also floated left so that they sit in a neat little line!

Once we have our scroller constructed, we call our scroller class like so:

myscroll = new scroller(
	-> name of the inner scroll element; the bit that's actually going to move,
	-> width of the outer div,
	-> width of an individual column,
	-> number of columns,
	-> a loop back boolean, true or false - if true, when you try and scroll past the end of the scroller in either direction, it loops back on itself
)

We then set up left and right scroll elements which, when clicked, will perform the shifting.

These need to have onclick values of myscroll.left_scroll() - shifts the inner div to the left; and myscroll().right_scroll() - shifts the div to the right.

Have a look at the included index.php for example usage; drop me a line at andrewbeeken.co.uk if you find this useful!
